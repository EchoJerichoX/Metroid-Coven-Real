(Yes, it's like a readme, but radder)

Samus sprites by Phazon Yoshi.

1) They are really badly named, though there is some logic.
2)Some transitions only have one way. 
If you can't reverse through either code or a gif utitity or some crap;
you don't deserve to use them.
3)Give credit to Phazon Yoshi, somehow.
4)If there's anything missing, PM me, preferably with the sprite, but I'd be happy to rip it anyway.
