Special Thanks
--------------

Talented and inspired people have been sending me weapon 
suggestions since 1993 for both Scorched Tanks and now
Pocket Tanks. I've had the wonderful opportunity to review 
neat ideas for many years and be positively influenced 
by everyone's enthusiasm and encouragement.  

But this is a special thanks to the folks in the Blitwise
forum community who were in the right place at the right time
to help inspire this weapon pack.  Thank you for sharing 
your ideas.

Cheers!
