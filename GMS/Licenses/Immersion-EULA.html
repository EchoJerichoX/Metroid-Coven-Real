        developed by You that You have either (a) identified to Immersion in writing via email to
        HapticsDev@immersion.com (or such other email address as Immersion may provide from time to

        any entity on whose behalf You are acting, and the name and a reasonable description of the
        Android Application), or (b) identified to Immersion in writing via Immersion’s registration
        requirements at the time You download the Haptic SDK as including a copy of the Haptic SDK
        (which writing must include Your contact information, any entity on whose behalf You are acting,
        and the name and a reasonable description of the Android Application).

        this Agreement, Immersion hereby grants to You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license
        (without the right to sublicense) solely during the Term: (i) to copy the Haptic SDK (in object code

        makes Video Game Applications available for download to end users of such Video Game
        Applications in such Internet distribution service websites’ ordinary course of business (“<u>Online

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Grants to Immersion.</b> In partial consideration for the licenses granted herein by

        infringes any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You. You represent and warrant
        that You have the full power to enter into this Agreement and have the ability to grant the license
        and covenant granted to Immersion and its affiliates hereunder.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Attribution; Most Current Version of the Haptic SDK.</b> In partial consideration for
        the licenses granted herein by Immersion, You agree to prominently display the following language
        within Your promotional or other materials which promote or describe the Haptic SDK Android
        Application (e.g., Android Market application description webpage, etc.): “Integrated with
        Immersion Haptic Effects.” In partial consideration for the licenses granted herein by Immersion,
        You agree to download and incorporate into Your Haptic SDK Android Applications the most
        currently available version of the Haptic SDK.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Audit Rights.</b> At Immersion’s written request, from time to time, (a) You will
        verify in writing Your compliance with this Agreement, and (b) Immersion may have an
        independent auditor review Your books, records, systems, and facilities to audit Your compliance
        with this Agreement. Any such audit shall be at Immersion’s expense; provided that if such audit
        reveals any material breach of this Agreement, You shall promptly pay to Immersion all costs and
        expenses of such audit. You shall correct any noncompliance.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Other Restrictions.</b> You will not copy or use the Haptic SDK (including the
        Documentation) except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. You will not, and will not
        directly or indirectly permit, authorize or otherwise assist any third party to, (i) distribute any
        Haptic SDK Android Application (A) with any hardware device (e.g., preinstalled on a mobile
        phone, etc.) or in connection with the sale of a hardware device (e.g., sold as a Video Game
        Application bundled with a mobile phone, etc.), or (B) in any manner other than via an Online
        Distribution Website (or Your website), or (ii) reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile the
        Haptic SDK, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, and then only after You
        have notified Immersion in writing of Your intended activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Ownership.</b> Immersion will retain all right, title and interest in and to the patent,
        copyright, trademark, trade secret and any other intellectual property rights in the Haptic SDK and
        the Documentation, and in each case, any derivative works thereof (by whomever produced),
        subject only to the limited licenses set forth in this Agreement. You do not acquire any other
        rights, express or implied, in the Haptic SDK or the Documentation other than those rights
        expressly granted under this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything in
        this Agreement to the contrary, Immersion does not grant any license hereunder with respect to
        any patent or patents infringed by the use or operation of any Haptic SDK Android Application on
        or with any hardware or the making, use, sale, offering for sale or importation of any hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>No Support.</b> Immersion has no obligation to provide support, maintenance,
        upgrades, modifications or new releases under this Agreement.        
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Right to Anonymously Track Use of the Haptic SDK.</b> Immersion reserves the right
        to anonymously track and report Your use of the Haptic SDK and any end user’s use of a Haptic
        SDK Android Application. You shall notify end users of Your Haptic SDK Android Applications
        that Immersion reserves the right to anonymously track and report use of Haptic SDK Android
        Applications by end users.
    </p>
        <b>3. NO WARRANTIES; REMEDIES</b>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>No Warranties.</b> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE
        LAW, (1) IMMERSION MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR
        IMPLIED, OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE HAPTIC SDK OR THE DOCUMENTATION,
        (2) THE HAPTIC SDK AND THE DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITH NO
        WARRANTY, (3) YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE HAPTIC SDK AND THE
        DOCUMENTATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND (4) IMMERSION EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
        WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE HAPTIC SDK AND
        THE DOCUMENTATION INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE AND NONINFRINGEMENT,
        AND ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF COURSE OF
        PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. Immersion does not warrant that
        the Haptic SDK or any application incorporating the Haptic SDK will operate in combination with
        hardware, software, systems or data not provided by Immersion, except as expressly specified in
        the Documentation, or that the operation of the Haptic SDK or any application incorporating the
        Haptic SDK will be uninterrupted or error-free.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Limitation of Liability.</b> IN NO EVENT WILL IMMERSION BE LIABLE FOR ANY
        INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES
        FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, BUSINESS, SAVINGS, DATA, USE OR COST OF
        SUBSTITUTE PROCUREMENT, INCURRED BY EITHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY,
        WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF IMMERSION HAS BEEN ADVISED
        OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE. TO
        THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL IMMERSION’S
        LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY
        (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), EXCEED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
        (U.S.$250). THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS
        SECTION 3.2 AND IN THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ALLOCATION
        OF RISK HEREIN ARE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES,
        WITHOUT WHICH IMMERSION WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT.
    </p>
        <b>4. TERMINATION</b>
    <p>
        This Agreement is effective from the date You accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement
        until December 31, 2013 (the “Term”). Immersion may terminate this Agreement at any time
        upon Your breach of any of the provisions hereof. Either party may terminate this Agreement with
        thirty (30) days prior notice (which, in the case of notice delivered to You, may be delivered via
        the email address or physical address provided by You when requesting or downloading the Haptic
        SDK). Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, You will cease all use of the Haptic SDK,
        return to Immersion or destroy the Haptic SDK and all Documentation and related materials in
        Your possession, and so certify to Immersion. Except for the licenses granted to You herein and as
        otherwise expressly provided herein, the terms of this Agreement will survive expiration or
        termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon expiration or termination of this Agreement
        (except for a termination by Immersion based on Your breach), subject to Your compliance with
        the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You may continue to exercise the license granted in           
        Section 2.1(ii) with respect to the then-current versions of Haptic SDK Android Applications that
        are then-commercially available to end users.
    </p>
        <b>5. GENERAL TERMS</b>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Changes to this Agreement.</b> Immersion may make changes to or otherwise amend
        this Agreement:
        (a) as it distributes new versions of the Haptic SDK -- Immersion will make
        the new version of this Agreement available on the website where the Haptic SDK is made

        least thirty (30) days prior written notice to You (which may be delivered via the email address or
        physical address provided by You when requesting or downloading the Haptic SDK).
        You agree that, if You do not agree with any change made by Immersion pursuant to Section
        5.1(b) above, this Agreement (without such change) shall automatically terminate as of the date in
        which such change would become effective and, accordingly, Your right to use the previously
        released version of the Haptic SDK shall terminate (subject to the limited survival rights provided
        under Section 4 above).
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Confidentiality.</b> You agree not to disclose to any third party (i) the terms and
        conditions of this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any Documentation or other written
        documentation provided to You pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) any other Confidential
        Information of Immersion (including the contents of any software components of the Haptic SDK).

        any non-public information (including business and/or technical information) of Immersion that is
        designated as confidential or proprietary by Immersion (or which, under all of the circumstances,
        should reasonably be treated as confidential). Confidential Information shall include, without
        limitation, (i) business information, pricing and terms, related product documentation, technical
        data, algorithms, software (whether in object or source code), performance statistics, future plans,
        product road maps, customer and employee information, know-how (including reference designs),
        trade secrets, and other information of a non-public nature that is known or used by Immersion,
        and (ii) information, whether disclosed in writing, orally or visually, that is designated
        “confidential,” “proprietary,” or which, under all of the circumstances, should reasonably be
        treated as confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Indemnification.</b> You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Immersion and
        its affiliates, and their successors, assigns, officers, directors, employees, and agents, from any
        claim, liability, loss, damage, lien, judgment, and cost, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
        litigation expenses, with respect to any component of a Haptic SDK Android Application (other
        than the Haptic SDK).
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Law.</b> This Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement
        will be governed by the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice
        of law rule. This Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts
        for the International Sales of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. In the event
        of any controversy, claim or dispute between the parties arising out of or relating to this
        Agreement, such controversy, claim or dispute may be tried solely in a state or federal court for
        Santa Clara County, California, and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction and
        venue of such courts.    
    </p>
    <p>    
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Severability and Waiver.</b> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal,
        invalid or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the extent possible
        consistent with the stated intention of the parties, or, if incapable of such enforcement, will be
        deemed to be severed and deleted from this Agreement, while the remainder of this Agreement
        will continue in full force and effect. The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this
        Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>No Assignment.</b> You may not assign, sell, transfer, delegate or otherwise dispose
        of, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, this Agreement or any
        rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Immersion. Any
        purported assignment, transfer or delegation by You will be null and void. Subject to the
        foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their
        respective successors and assigns.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Export Administration.</b> You will comply fully with all relevant export laws and
        regulations of the United States, including, without limitation, the U.S. Export Administration
        Regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>U.S. Government End Users.</b> The Haptic SDK and Documentation are
        “commercial computer software,” as that term is defined in the U.S. Federal Acquisition
        Regulations. The Haptic SDK and Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end
        users (a) only as commercial computer software and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all
        other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Entire Agreement.</b> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
        parties and, other than any Immersion license agreement manually signed by the parties,
        supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, written or oral, concerning
        the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this
        Agreement and a manually-signed Immersion license agreement, the terms of such manuallysigned
        license agreement will control. Except as provided under Section 5.1 above, this
        Agreement may not be modified or amended except in a writing signed by a duly authorized
        representative of each party; no other act, document, usage or custom will be deemed to amend or
        modify this Agreement. It is expressly agreed that the terms of this Agreement will supersede the
        terms in any of Your purchase orders or other ordering documents.
